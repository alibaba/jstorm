Being the largest online marketplace in China. Taobao serves over 400 million active users every month. During the first eight minutes of the 11.11 Global Shopping festival of 2015, the GMV reached more than $1 billion. Stream processing has been playing a crucial role in Taobao's infrastructure in a variety of business scenarios. In this talk, I will share how Taobao uses stream processing techniques to support a wide range of business applications, such as fraud detection, online transaction processing, mobile internet, mobile payment, and risk control for online transactions. We will also discuss the key architecture that made it possible for Taobao to process hundreds of billions of events in real time every day. In particular, we will present JStorm, an open sourced stream processing platform that empowers most of Taobao's realtime stream data systems.
